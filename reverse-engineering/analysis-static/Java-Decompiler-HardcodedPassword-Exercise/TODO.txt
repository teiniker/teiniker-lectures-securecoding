Exercise: Java Decompiler - Password
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "HardcodedPassword.jar" file, we can run the application:

$ java -cp HardcodedPassword.jar org.se.lab.CheckPassword
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Extract Password
Use static reverse engineering techniques to extract the hardcoded password.
Try to login with the found password - only when you see the following message,
you have extracted the right password:
    "Welcome, you have entered a valid password!"

TODO: <<found password>>
hjHGzu&56nm;

B) Storage Algorithm
Describe the algorithm which has been used to build the password:
