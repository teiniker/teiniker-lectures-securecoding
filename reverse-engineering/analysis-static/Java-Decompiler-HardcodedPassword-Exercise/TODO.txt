Exercise: Java Decompiler - Password
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "HardcodedPassword.jar" file, we can run the application:

$ java -cp HardcodedPassword.jar org.se.lab.CheckPassword
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Analyze Storage Algorithm
Describe the algorithm which has been used to build the password:

TODO: <<step by step description>>
"VvnoWnioi8hjHGzu&56nm;:mkhjghfg"

B) Extract Password
Based on the found algorithm, re-construct the stored password.
Try to login with the found password - only when you see the following message,
you have extracted the right password:

    "Welcome, you have entered a valid password!"

TODO: <<found password>>
hjHGzu&56nm;
