/*
 * RFC 867 daytime service
 * 
 * A daytime service simply sends a the current date and time as a character 
 * string without regard to the input.
 * 
 * One daytime service is defined as a connection based application on TCP.  
 * A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 13.  
 * Once a connection is established the current date and time is sent out the 
 * connection as a ascii character string (and any data received is thrown 
 * away).  
 * The service closes the connection after sending the quote.
 * There is no specific syntax for the daytime.
