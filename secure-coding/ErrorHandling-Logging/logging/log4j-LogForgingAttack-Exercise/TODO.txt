Exercise: Logging - Log Forging Attack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever user data is written to a log file, caution is required. Attackers can
inject incorrect log lines to prevent or influence an automated evaluation of
log files.


LogEncoder Class
----------------

Implement a class called "LogEncoder" with the following static method:

    public static String encode(String message)

This method replaces dangerous characters like '\n' and '\r' with '_'.

Use "LogForgingAttackTest" to test your encoder method.
