Exercise: Error Handling - Code Coverage
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Code coverage measurement is a dynamic code analysis technique that
can be used to find out code areas which are not covered by your
test suite.

In practice, error handling code as a insufficient code coverage 
because it is hard to test - we need test doubles to simulate error
conditions for the system under test.

In Eclipse, you can use the EclEmma plugin to measure the code
coverage of your test suite.
1. Help/Eclipse Marketplace...
2. Search for "EclEmma" 
3. Install this plugin
4. Right-click on your test class, select "Coverage As / JUnit Test"
5. Review your code - all lines marked red are not executed during
	the tests (green lines are executed, yellow lines are partly 
	executed).
	
	
1. Code Coverage Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the given "UserServiceTest" class and analyze the code coverage
of the class "UserService".
It should be 65.5%, but more important, you can see that the error
handling code is not tested.


2. Test Error Handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Extend the given "UserDAOStub" and "UserServiceTest" classes to 
increase the code coverage of "UserService" to 100%.


3. Bugfix 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix the problem in the current error handling code.
