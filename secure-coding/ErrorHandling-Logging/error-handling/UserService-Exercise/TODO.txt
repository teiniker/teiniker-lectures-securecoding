Exercise: Error Handling - Code Coverage
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Code coverage measurement is a dynamic code analysis technique that
can be used to find out code areas which are not covered by your
test suite.

In practice, error handling code as a insufficient code coverage 
because it is hard to test - we need test doubles to simulate error
conditions for the system under test.

1. Code Coverage Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the given "UserServiceTest" class and analyze the code coverage
of the class "UserService".
It should be 65.5%, but more important, you can see that the error
handling code is not tested.

2. Test Error Handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Extend the given "UserDAOStub" and "UserServiceTest" classes to 
increase the code coverage of "UserService" to 100%.

3. Bugfix 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix the problem in the current error handling code.
