Exercise: Error Handling - Crypto API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many methods of the Java Crypto API throw Checked Exceptions. To be able to work
better with these exceptions, they should be converted into Runtime Exceptions.

HashUtility Class
-----------------
Implement a class called "HashUtility" and add the following methods:

    public static String sha256AsBase64String(String message)

    public static String sha256AsHexString(String message)

Look into the "SHATest" class to see how these methods can be implemented.
Note that you correctly implement the error handling.

Use "HashUtilityTest" to verify your implementations.
