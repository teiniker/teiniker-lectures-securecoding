Exercise: Custom Serialization Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extend the given "FileEntry" class with a customized serialization method:

    void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)

Within this method, load a serialized FileEntry object, create a new instance,
and write the "content" byte array to the given "path" in the file system.

Use "FileEntrySerializationTest" to validate your implementations.

WARNING:
Imagine what a vulnerability such a class would add to your application...
