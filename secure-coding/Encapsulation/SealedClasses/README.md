# Sealed Classes and Interfaces

This feature is about enabling more **fine-grained inheritance control** in Java. 
**Sealing allows classes and interfaces to define their permitted subtypes**.

In other words, a class or an interface can now define which classes can implement or extend it. 
It is a useful feature for domain modeling and increasing the security of libraries.

A class hierarchy enables us to reuse code via inheritance. 
However, the class hierarchy can also have other purposes. 
Code reuse is great but is not always our primary goal.

In **earlier versions**, Java provided limited options in the area of inheritance control:
* A **final** class can have no subclasses.
* A **package-private** class can only have subclasses in the same package.

The main motivation behind sealed classes is to have the possibility for a superclass to be widely accessible 
but not widely extensible. The sealed feature introduces a couple of new modifiers and clauses in Java: 
**sealed**, **non-sealed**, and **permits**.

## Sealed Classes
We can seal classes by applying the same **sealed** modifier. 
The **permits** clause should be defined after any extends or implements clauses:

_Example_: Sealed base class 
```Java
public sealed class User permits Admin
{
    public User(int id, String firstName, String lastName, String mail) 
    {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
    @Override
    public String toString() 
    {
        return "User: " + getId() + "," + getFirstName() + "," + getLastName() + "," + getMail();
    }
}
```

A **permitted subclass** must define a modifier. It may be declared **final** to prevent any further extensions:

_Example_: Final subclass
```Java
public final class Admin extends User
{
    public Admin(int id, String firstName, String lastName, String mail)
    {
        super(id, firstName, lastName, mail);
    }
    // ...
    @Override
    public String toString()    
    {
        return "Admin: " + getId() + "," + getFirstName() + "," + getLastName() + "," + getMail();
    }
}
```

A **permitted subclass** may also be declared **sealed**. 
If we declare it **non-sealed**, then it is open for extension.

_Example_: Non-sealed subclass
```Java
public non-sealed class Admin extends User
{
    public Admin(int id, String firstName, String lastName, String mail)
    {
        super(id, firstName, lastName, mail);
    }
    // ...
    @Override
    public String toString()    
    {
        return "Admin: " + getId() + "," + getFirstName() + "," + getLastName() + "," + getMail();
    }
}
```

A sealed class imposes three important **constraints on its permitted subclasses**:
* All permitted subclasses must belong to the **same module as the sealed class**.
* Every permitted subclass must **explicitly extend the sealed class**.
* Every permitted subclass must **define a modifier: final, sealed, or non-sealed**.

## Sealed Interfaces
  To seal an interface, we can apply the **sealed** modifier to its declaration. 
  The **permits** clause then specifies the classes that are permitted to implement the sealed interface.

_Example_:
```Java
public sealed interface XmlElement permits Dependency
{
  String toXml();
}
```

```Java
public final class Dependency
    implements XmlElement 
{
  // ...
}
```
