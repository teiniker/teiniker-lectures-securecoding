Exercise: Encapsulation - Private List Attack
---------------------------------------------------------------------

With the given implementation of the "User" class, we can attack the 
internal (private) list of "EMail" objects very easily - just run
the "AttackUserTest" class.

Refactor the "User" class to remove these code vulnerabilities, and
to make the test cases work.
