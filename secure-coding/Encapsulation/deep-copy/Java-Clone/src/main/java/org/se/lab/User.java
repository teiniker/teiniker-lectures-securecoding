/**
 * The Cloneable interface was intended as a mixin interface for objects to
 * advertise that they permit cloning. Unfortunately, it fails to serve this
 * purpose.
 * Its primary flaw is that it lacks a clone() method, and java.lang.Object's
 * clone() method is protected.
 * 
 * A given class can have one of four different attitudes toward clone():
 * 
 * o Support clone().
 *   Such a class implements Cloneable and declares its clone method to throw 
 *   no exceptions.
 *   
 * o Conditionally support clone().
 *   Such a class might be a collection class that can be cloned in principle
 *   but cannot successfully be cloned unless its contents can be cloned.
 *   Or a class may have the ability to be cloned.
 *   This kind of class will implement Cloneable, but will let its clone()
 *   method pass through any CloneNotSupportedException it may receive
 *   from other objects it tries to clone.
 *  
 * o Allow subclasses to support clone but don't publicly support it.
 *   Such a class does not implement Cloneable, but if the default 
 *   implementation of clone isn't correct, the class provides a protected 
 *   clone implementation that clones its fields correctly. 
 *  
 * o Forbid clone.
 *   Such a class does not implement Cloneable and provides a clone method
 *   that always throws CloneNotSupportedException.

     * Clone method

     * current state of the object on which clone was invoked.
     * The simplest way to make a class that can be cloned is to declare that it
     * implements the Cloneable interface, and override the clone method,
     * re-declaring it to be public.
