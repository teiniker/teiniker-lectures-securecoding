# Encapsulation

A well-designed software module **hides all of its implementation details**, 
clearly separating its API from its Implementation. 
Modules then communicate only through their APIs.

This concept, known as information hiding or **encapsulation**, is also one of 
the fundamental principles of software design.

The following techniques are used to encapsulate data and restrict the visibility of data and functionality:

* [Deep Copy of Mutual Objects](deep-copy/)
* [Immutable Classes](immutable-classes/)
* [Java Reflection API](reflection/)
* [Java Module System](modules/)
* [Java Sealed Classes](sealed-classes/)
* [Object Serialization](serialization/)
