# Secure Coding

This section deals with **coding and code review techniques** that can be used to find **security problems at the implementation level**.

Based on the taxonomy of coding errors defined by Gary McGraw, we can split the secure coding field into the following parts:

* [Encapsulation](Encapsulation/)

* [Data Validation](DataValidation/)

* [Error Handling & Logging](ErrorHandling-Logging/)
