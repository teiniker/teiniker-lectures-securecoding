Exercise: Precise Floating Point Calculation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a simple "FloatingPointCalculator" class which calculates the sum of a
given EUR value 100 times.

Because the regular floating point processing is not precise, the result is not
exact so the given test fails.

Improve the given "FloatingPointCalculator" class to to calculate the exact result.

Verify your implementation with the "FloatingPointCalculatorTest" class.
