Exercise: Input Validation - EMail Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement an immutable class called "EMail" that stores a single email address.
Validate the string passed by the constructor to ensure to store a proper
email address.

Read the test cases in "EMailTest" to get an overview about accepted
and rejected mail addresses.

Tip: Use "^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$"
