Exercise: Value Object - EMail Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a Value Object (immutable class) called "EMail" that stores a
single email address.

Validate the string passed to the constructor to ensure the storage of
a proper email address.

Read the test cases in "EMailTest" to get an overview about accepted
and rejected mail addresses.

Tip: Don't miss the normalization!

Tip: Use "^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$"
