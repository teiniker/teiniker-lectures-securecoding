Exercise: Password Check with Encryption - Reverse Engineering (Static Analysis)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the executable named "password_check".

$ ./password_check 
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Hardcoded password [3 points] 
Use static reverse engineering techniques to extract the hardcoded password.

hardcoded password: TODO


B) Decrypt password [7 points]
Find out how the password will be encrypted and decrypt the found password.
For the process of decryption, extend the "decrypt_password.c" file, so that
the plaintext password will be printed out.

plaintext password: TODO
