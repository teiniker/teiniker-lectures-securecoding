Exercise: Password check
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given an executable named "password_check" which asks for a password and 
validates the entered string. 

$ ./password_check 
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

If we pick a password which satisfies all these constraints, it will be accepted.
Otherwise, it will be rejected.

A) Static Analysis 
By using static reverse engineering techniques, find out the constraints a 
password must fulfill to be accepted. 

Write down the constraints:

Give an example of a valid passord:
