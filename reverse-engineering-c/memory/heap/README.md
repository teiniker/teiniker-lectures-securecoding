# Using the Heap

The heap segment is used in programs to implement dynamic data structures. 
These data structures grow as needed by constantly reserving new memory on 
the heap.

When using the heap memory, it is important to pay attention to where memory 
is allocated and where memory is freed. **There must be no memory leaks**.
