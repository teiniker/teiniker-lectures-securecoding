Exercise: Password Brute Force Attack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a test case, which uses the stings stored in "wordlist.txt" to brute
force attack a given MD5 hash value.

Read every line from the "wordlist.txt", calculate the hash value and compare
it with the given one.
If the hash values match, you have found the right string in the wordlist.

Tipp: MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
